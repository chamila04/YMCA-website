        <p class="mt-3">The Kandy Young Men's Christian Association, commonly known as YMCA, is a community-driven organization
            dedicated to actively engaging with and addressing pressing social issues in the local community. With a
            commitment to making a positive impact, YMCA seeks to unite young men who share a belief in Jesus Christ as
            their God and Savior, as guided by the Holy Scriptures. Their mission is to foster discipleship in faith and
            life, working collaboratively to extend the Kingdom of Jesus Christ among young men.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5 mb-5">
            YMCA currently operates without a proper system for room reservations. The absence of a digital solution
            results in manual logbook record-keeping, causing inefficiencies, time delays, and an increased risk of
            errors. Implementing a new web-based reservation system aims to streamline processes and enhance overall
            efficiency for both staff and members
